# Japanese Kanji Database
The application in this repository shows a list of Japanese characters needed to pass the N5 level of Japanese Language Proficency Test (JLTP).


It was created with unity being my first app made with this engine. The code is very sloppy and coarse, not very intuitive. The app was made for my private use
and was not thoroughly tested nor it was adjusted for other users.


The mobile phone model it was made for is Samsung Galaxy S3 with 4,8 inches display.

I will not continue and will not update this project.
